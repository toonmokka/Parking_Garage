# Parking_Garage
Using Object-Oriented Programming, this program simulates a parking garage, with multiple levels with multiple spots.
The project is designed on the following assumptions:
Assumptions
1. The parking garage has multiple levels. Each level has multiple rows of spots.
2. The parking garage can park motorcycles, cars, and buses.
3. The parking garage has motorcycle spots, compact spots, and large spots.
4. A motorcycle can park in any spot.
5. A car can park in either a single compact spot or a single large spot.
6. A bus can park in five large spots that are consecutive and within the same row. It cannot park in small spots.
